# Advent Of Code submissions - 2023

This event was an opportunity to learn C++ the practical way.
My solutions are not meant to be "good" c++ lmao (plz dont even look at day 2 code )

## Notes on solution

- Day 2: Awful code. sorry.
- Day 5: Not the fastest. Could be really faster. But who cares ?

## How to run my solutions


Inside day folder, run

    meson setup builddir

to setup everything for the build, then

    meson compile -C builddir && ./builddir/aoc
